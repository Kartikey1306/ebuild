"""The CI workflow must expose one job that summarises all the others.

#87 asks for a required status check on `master`. Branch protection can only
require a check by name, and the names this workflow produces are not usable
for that directly: `test` is a matrix, so it arrives as nine generated names
that change with the matrix, and `release` is skipped on every pull request.

So `ci-gate` exists to be the one name to require. These tests keep it honest
-- specifically, they fail if someone adds a job to the workflow and does not
wire it into the gate, which would otherwise silently create a job that the
required check does not cover.
